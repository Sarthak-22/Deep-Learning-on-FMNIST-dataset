# Deep Learning on FMNIST dataset
### Using Neural Networks , Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on open-source FMNIST dataset

1) [DL Task-01](https://github.com/Sarthak-22/Deep-Learning-on-FMNIST-dataset/blob/main/DL%20Task-01.ipynb) uses the inbuilt FMNIST dataset from **Keras** framework and uses a 2-hidden layer **Neural Network** for predicting output.
2) [DL Task-02](https://github.com/Sarthak-22/Deep-Learning-on-FMNIST-dataset/blob/main/DL%20Task-02.ipynb) uses the same inbuilt FMNIST dataser from **Keras** framework and uses a **Convolutional Neural Network** for predicting output.
3) Accuracy in case of CNN is greater than NN as expected.
